CSharpKDMDiscoverer
===================

C# 4.0 preprocessor, lexer, and parser in Java.

The used ANTLR-based C# grammar is based on the one available at https://github.com/ChristianWulf/CSharpGrammar. I adapt it to not only parse a C# source file but also to build an abstract syntax tree from it.
