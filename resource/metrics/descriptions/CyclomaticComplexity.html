		<p>This metric is an indication of the number of 'linear' segments in a method (<i>i.e.</i>sections of code with no branches) and therefore can be 
			used to determine the number of tests required to obtain complete coverage. It can also be used to indicate the psychological complexity of a 
			method.</p>
		<p>A method with no branches has a Cyclomatic Complexity of 1 since there is 1 arc. This number is incremented whenever a branch is encountered. In 
			this implementation, statements that represent branching are defined as: 'for', 'while', 'do', 'if', 'case' (optional), 'catch' (optional) and 
			the ternary operator (optional). The sum of Cyclomatic Complexities for methods in local classes is also included in the total for a method.</p>
		<p>Cyclomatic Complexity is a procedural rather than an OO metric. However, it still has meaning for OO programs at the method level.</p>
