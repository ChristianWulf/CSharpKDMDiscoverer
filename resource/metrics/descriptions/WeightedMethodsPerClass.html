		<p>This metric is the sum of complexities of methods defined in a class. It therefore represents the complexity of a class as a whole and this measure 
			can be used to indicate the development and maintenance effort for the class.</p>
		<p>In this implementation, the measure of complexity of methods is <a href="CyclomaticComplexity.html">McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity</a>.</p>
		<p>Classes with a large Weighted Methods Per Class value can often be refactored into two or more classes.</p>
